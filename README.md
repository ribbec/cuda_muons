# CUDA Muon Sampling Simulation

Lightweight tools to collect single-step Geant4 samples, build CUDA-friendly histograms, and run a GPU-accelerated muon sampler.

## Quick start

Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ and pip
- CUDA

If you are using uzh-physik cluster, you can use the same container used for muons_and_matter, i.e., shell the container with 

```
cd ..
shell_container.sh
```

To be able to run the CUDA code, one needs first to install the source code. You can do that by executing the script `install_cuda.sh`. The installation currently happens locally, (by using pip install --user). If you are using the container, be sure to execute this step (inside the container) when running for the first time. You won't need to do it again, unless you wish to modify the cuda source code.
When building inside the container, a good way to avoid errors when installing cuda is to clean some global variables before. Hence, if you face any bugs, run with the following sequence:
```
export PYTHONNOUSERSITE=0
aux_ld_preload="$LD_PRELOAD"
export LD_PRELOAD=""
source install_cuda.sh
export LD_PRELOAD="$aux_ld_preload"
unset aux_ld_preload
export PYTHONNOUSERSITE=1
```

## Sampling data

In [data](data), one can already find the histograms for some materials. If you wish to sample from different materials, you  need to do the following procedure, specifying the material as its Geant4 name
(the following is an example to generate the histograms for iron):

1. Collect single-step sampling data from Geant4 outputs:
   - Run the extractor script:
     ```
     python3 utils_cuda_muons/collect_single_step_data.py --material G4_Fe
     ```

2. Build histograms used by the CUDA sampler:
   - Run:
     ```
     python3 utils_cuda_muons/build_histograms.py --alias --material G4_Fe
     ```


## Running a simulation

   `project/cuda_muons` is a Python package and its modules use relative imports, so the
   main simulator and the scripts under `experiments/` are run as modules **from the repo
   root** (not as bare files from inside this directory):
     ```
     uv run -m project.cuda_muons.cuda_muons
     uv run -m project.cuda_muons.experiments.validate_muon_env
     ```
   (The data-sampling helpers under `utils_cuda_muons/` are still run from inside this
   directory, e.g. `python3 utils_cuda_muons/build_histograms.py --alias --material G4_Fe`.)
